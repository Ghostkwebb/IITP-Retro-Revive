# Impossible Pacman

## Project Overview

Dive into a fresh and unpredictable Pacman experience with **Impossible Pacman**! This isn't your classic arcade game. We've taken the familiar ghost-dodging, pellet-munching gameplay and added a twist: **each level is generated uniquely every time you play**. Using a random walk algorithm, the maze layout is different in every game, ensuring endless replayability and challenging you to adapt to new environments.

But that's not all! Do you feel like setting your challenge? **Impossible Pacman allows you to define the win score before you start a level**. Whether you prefer a quick dash for a low score or a marathon session aiming for a high one, the choice is yours. Get ready for an "impossible" level of Pacman fun where no two games are the same!

## Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

You can play the game using one of the following methods:

**1. Using the Executable:**

   a. Navigate to the [Releases](link_to_your_releases_page) section of this GitHub repository.
   b. Look for the latest release or a specific version you want to play.
   c. Download the executable file (it might be a `.exe` file for Windows, a `.app` file for macOS, or a similar format depending on the platform).
   d. Once the download is complete, locate the executable file on your computer.
   e. Double-click the executable file to run the game. The game should start without requiring additional software installation (assuming you are on a compatible operating system).

**2. Cloning the Repository and Using Unity:**

   a. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have **Unity version 6000.0.41f1** installed on your computer. You can download specific Unity versions from the Unity Hub or the Unity website.
   b. **Clone the Repository:**
      * Open your terminal or command prompt.
      * Navigate to the directory where you want to save the project files.
      * Run the following command to clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone [repository_url]
        ```
        (Replace `[repository_url]` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository).
   c. **Open the Project in Unity:**
      * Launch the Unity Hub (if you have it) or open the Unity application (version 6000.0.41f1).
      * In Unity Hub, click on "Add" and browse to the directory where you cloned the repository. Select the project folder and click "Add Project".
      * Alternatively, in the Unity application, go to "File" -> "Open Project..." and navigate to the cloned repository folder. Select the project and click "Open".
   d. **Wait for Unity to Load:** Unity will take some time to load the project files and import assets.
